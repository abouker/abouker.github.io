I am passionate for new technologies (Cloud, Kubernetes, Web, E-Business and Big Data).
I participated in many major projects in Java / JEE (Full Stack) with agile method.
I have in-depth knowledge in the development of big applications in Java/JEE (Web, E-Business sites, back-office applications, Multithreading, etc.) with a Full Stack background and an in-depth vision beyond programming and a strong adaptability.
